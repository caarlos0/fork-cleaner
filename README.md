## Installation

### Homebrew

```sh
brew install caarlos0/tap/fork-cleaner
```

### snap

```sh
snap install fork-cleaner
```

### apt

```sh
echo 'deb [trusted=yes] https://repo.caarlos0.dev/apt/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caarlos0.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fork-cleaner
```

### yum

```sh
echo '[caarlos0]
name=caarlos0
baseurl=https://repo.caarlos0.dev/yum/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0' | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/caarlos0.repo
sudo yum install fork-cleaner
```

### deb/rpm/apk

Download the `.apk`, `.deb` or `.rpm` from the [latest release](https://github.com/caarlos0/fork-cleaner/releases/latest) and install with the appropriate commands.

### Manually

Download the binaries from the [latest release](https://github.com/caarlos0/fork-cleaner/releases/latest) or clone the repository and build from source.

## Usage

You'll need to [create a personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,delete_repo&description=fork-cleaner) with `repo` and `delete_repo`
permissions. You'll need to pass this token to `fork-cleaner` with the `--token` flag.

```sh
fork-cleaner --token "<token>"
```

`fork-cleaner` will load your forked repositories, displaying the oldest first. This can take a little while as `fork-cleaner` will iterate over the page of forks and check the upstream repository's status (e.g. checking for active PRs).

## Troubleshooting

### Taking forever to load?

The app hits various endpoints in order to collect information on the upstream repository, this can take a while if you have a lot of forks. Setting `-skip-upstream=true` will skip checking commits, issues, PRs, etc on each upstream repository, potentially alleviating this issue.

### I've hit the rate limit.

You can check your current limits by calling GitHub's API:

```sh
curl -L \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  https://api.github.com/rate_limit
```
