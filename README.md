## Installation

### Homebrew

```sh
brew install caarlos0/tap/fork-cleaner
```

### snap

```sh
snap install fork-cleaner
```

### apt

```sh
echo 'deb [trusted=yes] https://repo.caarlos0.dev/apt/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caarlos0.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fork-cleaner
```

### yum

```sh
echo '[caarlos0]
name=caarlos0
baseurl=https://repo.caarlos0.dev/yum/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0' | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/caarlos0.repo
sudo yum install fork-cleaner
```

### deb/rpm/apk

Download the `.apk`, `.deb` or `.rpm` from the [latest release](https://github.com/caarlos0/fork-cleaner/releases/latest) and install with the appropriate commands.

### Manually

Download the binaries from the [latest release](https://github.com/caarlos0/fork-cleaner/releases/latest) or clone the repository and build from source.

## Usage

You'll need to [create a personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,delete_repo&description=fork-cleaner) with `repo` and `delete_repo`
permissions. You'll need to pass this token to `fork-cleaner` with the `--token` flag.

### Local mode

This is a newly added mode, which scans one or more git repositories that you have checked out (cloned) locally.
It marks each repository, as either "clean" (safe to delete), or "dirty" (not safe to delete).

For a repository to be marked clean, it needs to meet all of the following conditions:

* there are no uncommitted changes: `git status` is clean.
* all branches (technically, their HEAD commit) are found in a remote named "upstream" or "origin". 
* there is nothing in the stash.

Limitations:

* if your local branches are found in a remote that goes by another name, they are not considered "safely merged" ("clean")
  (could add an optional flag to support this)
* we can only check for the presence of commits hosted on GitHub. Other hosts/remotes are ignored for now.
* branches that were integrated in the upstream/origin via a history-altering operation (e.g. squash-merged, rebase-merged) can't be detected.

In all these cases, since we can't prove "cleanliness", we mark affected repos as "dirty" out of caution.

### Remote mode

This is the original fork-cleaner mode.

```sh
fork-cleaner --token "<token>"
```

`fork-cleaner` will load your forked repositories, displaying the oldest first. This can take a little while as `fork-cleaner` will iterate over the page of forks and check the upstream repository's status (e.g. checking for active PRs).

## Troubleshooting

### Taking forever to load?

The app hits various endpoints in order to collect information on the upstream repository, this can take a while if you have a lot of forks. Setting `-skip-upstream=true` will skip checking commits, issues, PRs, etc on each upstream repository, potentially alleviating this issue.

### I've hit the rate limit.

You can check your current limits by calling GitHub's API:

```sh
curl -L \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  https://api.github.com/rate_limit
```
